# Online Shop
This project has been created with HTML, CSS3, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.

This project has been created and designed from scratch without using any pre-existing template online on the internet, I
used the framework Materialize along with Material Icons.

For the back-end I have created a REST API that handels User Registration and User Authentication, following the principals
of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) in this project not all of these are used.

For the front-end using jQuery I use AJAX when handling User Registration and User Authentication to display error messages
on the screen asynchronously that are being sent from the serverside REST API.

I have also included an AdminPortal / CSM to this project this can be found by in the directory ./AdminPortal .

Lastly I have included a sql file only with the users table, I Welcome you to register users and see how the front-end
and backend work together.

Many Thanks,
Ryan.
